In reading, they can understand simple sentences. In writing, they can produce basic phrases such as their name, age, or nationality, though grammar and spelling may often be incorrect but still understandable.`

      description: `A2 students can communicate in short conversations about familiar topics, though they may still pause while speaking. Their vocabulary is limited to everyday topics such as family, work, shopping, or hobbies. They can express basic opinions, describe simple experiences, and handle predictable situations in daily life. In reading, they can understand short, simple texts such as messages, personal letters, or brief articles on familiar topics. In writing, they can produce short paragraphs and simple connected sentences to describe events, people, or routines. Errors in grammar and spelling are still common, but the overall message is usually clear and understandable.`

      description: `B1 students can communicate with some confidence on familiar topics and in everyday situations, even though they may occasionally search for words. They can express opinions, give reasons, and describe experiences, dreams, or ambitions using connected sentences. Their vocabulary allows them to discuss most daily subjects such as work, travel, education, and leisure. In reading, they can understand the main ideas of clear texts on familiar topics, including short articles, emails, or stories. In writing, they can produce simple connected texts such as personal letters, essays, or reports, linking ideas with basic connectors like because, but, or so.`

      description: `B2 students can communicate clearly and effectively on a wide range of subjects, both familiar and less familiar. They can interact with native speakers with a good degree of fluency, though occasional hesitation or searching for precise words may occur. In reading, they can understand the main ideas and details of complex texts, including articles, reports, and literary works, especially when the topics are of personal or professional interest. In writing, they can produce clear, detailed texts such as essays, reviews, or formal letters, organizing their ideas logically and using a range of linking devices. Some grammatical or lexical mistakes may still occur, but they rarely hinder communication.`

      slug: 'c1',
      image: '/levels/c1/c1_1.jpg',
      description: `C1 students can express themselves spontaneously without much obvious searching for words. They can use language flexibly and effectively for social, academic, and professional purposes. Their vocabulary range allows them to discuss complex subjects, express subtle shades of meaning, and adapt their tone to different contexts. In reading, they can understand a wide variety of demanding, longer texts and recognize implicit meaning, attitude, or opinion. In writing, they can produce well-structured, detailed texts on complex topics, showing controlled use of organizational patterns and cohesive devices. Although minor inaccuracies may appear, they are rare and do not affect clarity or precision.`
