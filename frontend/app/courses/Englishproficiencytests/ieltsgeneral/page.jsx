Unlike the Academic test, it's designed for practical, real-life English rather than university study. It's accepted by immigration authorities and employers in over 140 countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Ireland, and Singapore — some of the world's most popular destinations for migration and work."
